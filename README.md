# CCNA Project on Cisco Packet Tracer

This project was done as part of my CCNA practice on Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes step-by-step configuration and testing of a complete network topology.

## Configuration Steps

1. Network design and beautification.  
2. Basic settings to all devices + SSH + Standard ACL for SSH.  
3. VLAN assignment plus all access and trunk ports on 12 and 13 switches.  
4. STP Portfast and BPDUguard configs on all access ports.  
5. Etherchannel.  
6. Static and IP addressing.  
7. HSRP and Inter-VLAN routing on the 13 switches plus IP DHCP address.  
8. Static IP address to DMZ/server farm devices.  
9. DHCP server device configurations.  
10. Syslog on firewall, routers, and switches.  
11. Firewall interface security zones and levels.  
12. Firewall inspection policy configuration.  
13. Wireless network configurations.  
14. VOIP configs.  
15. Verifying and testing configurations.
